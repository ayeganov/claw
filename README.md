`claw` is a command-line utility that acts as an intelligent wrapper around your favorite Large Language Model (LLM) CLI (e.g., claude, gemini-cli). It transforms generic LLM sessions into powerful, goal-oriented workflows that are aware of your project's specific context, guidelines, and file structure.

Stop wasting time with repetitive setup prompts. With claw, you define a goal once and run it anywhere.

## How Is It Different From Smart Agents?

The main point of claw is that you are in control of the initial context that gets sent to the agent instead of hoping that agent figures out the right things to look at.

## Key Features
üéØ Goal-Oriented Sessions: Launch your LLM with a pre-defined purpose, like claw code-review or claw generate-tests.

üìö Cascading Configuration: Prioritizes repository-specific goals (./.claw/) over global user goals (~/.config/claw/), ensuring the most relevant context is always used.

‚öôÔ∏è Dynamic Context Gathering: Execute shell scripts (git diff, ls -R) before a session starts to feed information directly into your prompt avoiding costly tokens.

üìÅ File Context Management: Pass arbitrary files and directories via --context to include their contents in your prompt, with smart filtering, size limits, and binary detection.

ü§ñ Agent-Assisted Goal Creation: Use the innovative claw add command to have an LLM agent interactively guide you through creating and refining new goals.

üìú Powerful Templating: Uses the tera engine to inject command-line arguments and script outputs into your prompts.

üîç Dry-Run Mode: Preview the exact prompt that will be sent to the LLM with claw dry-run, perfect for debugging templates and context scripts.

### Prerequisites
Before using claw, you must have an underlying LLM command-line tool installed and available in your system's PATH. `claw` is a wrapper and does not include an LLM itself.

Examples:

- Anthropic's Claude Console (claude)
- Google's Gemini CLI (gemini)

### Installation

#### From Releases (Recommended)
Download the latest release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/ayeganov/claw/releases):

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**
```bash
# Download the .deb package
wget https://github.com/ayeganov/claw/releases/latest/download/claw_VERSION_amd64.deb

# Install
sudo dpkg -i claw_VERSION_amd64.deb
```

**macOS**
```bash
# Download the .dmg file
# Open the DMG and drag claw.app to /Applications

# Add to PATH by creating a symlink. I don't have a proper developer license for MacOS, so the binary is not signed
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/claw.app/
sudo ln -s /Applications/claw.app/Contents/MacOS/claw /usr/local/bin/claw
```

#### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayeganov/claw.git
cd claw
cargo build --release
# The binary will be in ./target/release/claw
```

The first time you run claw, it will automatically create a global configuration directory for you at ~/.config/claw/ with an example goal to get you started.

## Usage

### 1. Running a Goal
To run a goal, simply provide its name. Goal parameters are passed after `--` and are available in the prompt template.

```bash
# Run the 'code-review' goal
claw code-review

# Pass parameters to the prompt template
claw generate-component -- --name="UserProfile" --type="React"

# View goal-specific help and parameters
claw generate-component --explain
claw generate-component -e
```

### 2. Including File Context
Use the `--context` (or `-c`) flag to include files and directories in your prompt. This is perfect for code reviews, analysis, or any task that needs file contents.

```bash
# Include a single file
claw code-review --context src/main.rs

# Include multiple files
claw analyze --context file1.txt file2.txt config.json

# Include entire directories (recursive by default)
claw review --context ./src/ ./tests/

# Limit recursion depth
claw review --context ./src/ --recurse_depth 2

# Combine with goal parameters (note the -- separator)
claw review --context ./src/ -- --lang rust --scope authentication
```

**What happens:**
- Files are read and their contents are formatted as markdown
- Binary files are automatically skipped
- Respects `.gitignore` patterns
- Size limits and per-directory file limits are enforced
- The formatted context is appended to your prompt

**Configuration:** You can customize behavior in `claw.yaml`:
- `max_file_size_kb`: Maximum file size (default: 1024 KB)
- `max_files_per_directory`: Maximum files per directory (default: 50)
- `error_handling_mode`: How to handle errors - `strict`, `flexible`, or `ignore` (default: flexible)
- `excluded_directories`: Directories to skip (default: .git, node_modules, target, etc.)
- `excluded_extensions`: File extensions to skip (default: exe, bin, so, etc.)

### 3. Listing Goals
View all available goals and their parameters:

```bash
# List all goals (local and global)
claw list

# Or simply run claw with no arguments
claw

# List only local goals from .claw/ directory
claw list --local

# List only global goals from ~/.config/claw/
claw list --global
```

### 4. Dry-Run Mode (Preview Prompts)
Use `dry-run` to see exactly what prompt will be sent to the LLM without actually executing it. Perfect for debugging templates, verifying context scripts, and reviewing prompts before execution.

```bash
# Preview the rendered prompt to stdout
claw dry-run code-review

# Save the prompt to a file for inspection
claw dry-run code-review --output prompt.txt
claw dry-run code-review -o prompt.txt

# Dry-run with parameters
claw dry-run generate-tests -- --language rust --framework pytest

# Dry-run with file context
claw dry-run analyze-code --context src/main.rs src/lib.rs

# Dry-run with all features combined
claw dry-run review \
    --context ./src/ \
    --recurse_depth 2 \
    --output review_prompt.txt \
    -- --scope authentication --format markdown
```

**Use cases:**
- Debug goal templates and variable substitution
- Verify context scripts produce expected output
- Review prompts before sending to LLM
- Save prompts for documentation or testing
- Validate parameter handling without consuming API credits

**Note:** Dry-run executes all context scripts and processes file context exactly as a normal run would, ensuring you see the real prompt that will be sent.

### 5. Creating a New Goal (Agent-Assisted)
The `add` command launches an interactive LLM session to help you write a new prompt.yaml file.

```bash
# Start a session to create a new goal named 'pr-notes'
claw add pr-notes

# Force the new goal to be saved in the local project's .claw/ directory
claw add my-project-goal --local

# Force the new goal to be saved in the global ~/.config/claw/ directory
claw add my-global-goal --global
```

The agent will guide you through defining parameters if your goal needs them.

### 6. Direct Pass-Through
To open your underlying LLM directly without any modifications, use the `pass` command.

```bash
claw pass
# This is equivalent to just running 'claude' or 'gemini'
```

## Configuration
`claw` uses a simple configuration system based on YAML files.

### The `claw.yaml` File
This file configures which LLM claw should wrap and how context files are processed. It's looked for in ./.claw/ first, then ~/.config/claw/.

Example `~/.config/claw/claw.yaml`:

```yaml
# The executable name of the LLM CLI tool in your PATH.
llm_command: "claude"

# (Optional) The type of receiver to use for sending prompts.
# Options:
#   Generic: Uses the configured llm_command (default)
#   ClaudeCli: Hardcodes "claude" as the command
# receiver_type: "Generic"

# (Optional) The argument pattern for passing the prompt to the LLM.
# IMPORTANT: How prompts are sent depends on this template:
#   - If "{{prompt}}" is present: Prompt is passed as a command-line argument
#   - If "{{prompt}}" is NOT present: Prompt is piped to stdin
#
# Stdin mode (recommended for large contexts):
# prompt_arg_template: "--profile work"
#
# Argument mode (may hit shell limits with large prompts):
# prompt_arg_template: "--message {{prompt}}"
#
# For tools that read from stdin by default (like claude):
# prompt_arg_template: ""

# Context Management 2.0 Configuration
# These settings control how claw processes files passed via --context parameter

# Maximum file size in KB that can be included as context (default: 1024 = 1 MB)
max_file_size_kb: 1024

# Maximum number of files per directory when scanning (default: 50)
max_files_per_directory: 50

# How to handle errors during context processing (default: flexible)
# Options:
#   strict: Fail immediately on any error
#   flexible: Collect all errors and prompt user for approval before proceeding
#   ignore: Log warnings but continue processing valid files
error_handling_mode: flexible

# Directories to exclude when scanning for context files
excluded_directories:
  - ".git"
  - "node_modules"
  - "target"
  - ".venv"
  - "__pycache__"

# File extensions to exclude when scanning for context files
excluded_extensions:
  - "exe"
  - "bin"
  - "so"
  - "dylib"
  - "dll"
  - "o"
  - "a"
```

### Stdin vs Argument Mode

`claw` supports two methods for passing prompts to your LLM:

#### Stdin Mode (Recommended)
When `{{prompt}}` is **NOT** present in `prompt_arg_template`, the prompt is piped to the LLM's stdin:

```yaml
llm_command: "claude"
prompt_arg_template: "--profile work"
```

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No shell command-line length limits
- ‚úÖ Handles arbitrarily large contexts from `--context` parameter
- ‚úÖ Works with most modern LLM CLIs that read from stdin

**Use this mode when:**
- Working with large codebases via `--context`
- Your prompts include substantial file contents
- You want to avoid shell ARG_MAX errors

#### Argument Mode
When `{{prompt}}` **IS** present in `prompt_arg_template`, the prompt is passed as a command-line argument:

```yaml
llm_command: "my-llm"
prompt_arg_template: "chat --message {{prompt}}"
```

**Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Subject to shell argument length limits (typically 2MB, varies by system)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May fail with large contexts or long prompts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è claw will warn if prompt exceeds 1MB

**Use this mode when:**
- Your LLM tool requires prompts as arguments
- You're working with small to medium prompts
- Backward compatibility with existing configs

**Migration tip:** If you encounter "Argument list too long" errors, simply remove `{{prompt}}` from your `prompt_arg_template` and add any necessary flags instead.

### The `prompt.yaml` File
Each goal is defined by a prompt.yaml file located in a subdirectory of goals/.

Example `~/.config/claw/goals/pr-notes/prompt.yaml`:

```yaml
# A user-friendly name for display in lists.
name: "Pull Request Notes"

# A short, one-line description of the goal's purpose.
description: "Generates PR notes based on changes in the current branch."

# Optional: Define parameters that this goal accepts
parameters:
  - name: scope
    description: "The scope or focus area of the PR"
    required: true
    type: string

  - name: format
    description: "Output format for the notes"
    required: false
    type: string
    default: "markdown"

# A map of shell commands to run before the prompt.
# The output of each command is injected into the main prompt.
context_scripts:
  branch_diff: "git diff main...HEAD"
  file_list: "git diff --name-only main...HEAD"

# The main prompt template sent to the LLM.
# It can use variables from context_scripts like {{ Context.branch_diff }}
# and from the command line like {{ Args.scope }}.
prompt: |
  You are an expert at writing release notes. Based on the following git diff,
  please generate concise PR notes for a pull request.

  The scope of this PR is: {{ Args.scope }}
  Format: {{ Args.format }}

  Changed Files:
  {{ Context.file_list }}

  --- GIT DIFF ---
  ```diff
  {{ Context.branch_diff }}

  --- END DIFF ---

  Please provide a title, a short summary, and a bulleted list of detailed changes.
```

**Using this goal:**
```bash
# View available parameters
claw pr-notes --explain

# Run with required parameter
claw pr-notes -- --scope authentication

# Run with optional parameters
claw pr-notes -- --scope api --format json
```
